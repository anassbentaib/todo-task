Changes should be saved to local storage.
Delete Tasks:
Users can delete a task.
Confirmation should be required before deletion.
Interface:
The design should be simple, clean, and user-friendly using TailwindCSS.
The to-do list should display:
Task title.
Optional task description.
Created/last updated timestamp.
Modals:
Use modals for:
Adding a new task.
Editing a task.
Confirming the deletion of a task.
The modals should be responsive and styled using TailwindCSS for a modern look.
